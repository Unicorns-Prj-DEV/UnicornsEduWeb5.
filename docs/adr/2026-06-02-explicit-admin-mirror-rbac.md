# ADR: Assistant Admin-Mirror Policy

## Context

Assistant is expected to operate almost like admin across the admin-mirror surface, but a few high-risk areas must remain admin-only. The repo currently has both implicit assistant fallback and explicit per-endpoint overrides, so the documented policy must be unambiguous.

## Decision

Assistant is the default admin-mirror role on `@Roles(admin)` routes unless the endpoint explicitly denies it.

- `staff.assistant` should be able to use nearly all admin and staff-mirror operations.
- `@AllowAssistantOnAdminRoutes(false)` marks the exceptions that remain full-admin only.
- The current exceptions are admin dashboard aggregate routes and the direct-topup approval/queue/manual wallet-credit flows for student wallets. Assistant may still create a top-up request for admin approval and may withdraw/reduce student balance directly, but may not apply a positive manual wallet credit.

## Consequences

- Backend and frontend must keep the same exception list for assistant.
- Assistant may manage users, staff, classes, students, notifications, deductions, and other admin-mirror modules, but must not see the admin dashboard aggregate or directly approve/apply positive wallet top-ups. Creating a top-up request for admin approval remains allowed, and direct negative balance adjustments remain allowed.
- Docs must describe the assistant exception list explicitly instead of describing assistant as read-only or limited by default.
